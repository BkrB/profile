        <h2>📚 Lawyer 🔖</h2>
        <p>For the past few years, I have worked as a corporate lawyer specialising in structured finance. I have been based in London, Moscow and Milan working on a variety of international finance transactions.</p>

        <h2>🖥 Tech and Innovation 🛰</h2>
        <p>In 2019, I decided to take <em>Le Wagon</em> full stack coding bootcamp (Europe's no. 1 coding bootcamp!) to boost my tech skills and nurture my interest in technology in order to move my career into a technologically-focused direction.</p>

        <h2>📷 Photography 📽</h2>
        <p>I love taking pictures and have taken a few courses with the London Institute of Photography to boost my skills. I hope to do more in the future and create some great images. See my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcam/" target="_blank" id="insta-link">Instagram</a> for some shots.</p>

        <h2>🌯 Food and Wine 🍾</h2>
        <p>Food and wine have always been a passion of mine. I love cooking (and drinking wine!) and recently took a course with Le Cordon Bleu in London to get more culinary style 👨‍🍳.</p>
